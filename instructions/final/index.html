# Final: Tutorial Site

## Summary
Create a website design based around a tutorial of your choice. The site should instruct visitors on how to do something from start to finish, and why they'd want to do it. You will create the content, visual look and code the site pages in HTML and CSS.


#### Site content:
- Written step-by-step process or tips (at least 5)
- Photos/illustrations/videos of process
- Materials you need
- Description or example of completed work
- Explanation of why you would do this tutorial (or who is this good for?)
- Tips or descriptions of what is good or bad craft for the process
